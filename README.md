A html5, css and vanilla js website for a register kitchen cake and cupcake company. Sweets by Georgia Mae.

The aim of this website is to create value for the owner by automating transactions and the regualar messaging back and forth with her current instagram business model has. 

3 main changes have been implemented to her business website in hopes to create this value. 
  1. Being connecting a Google calendar API. Updateable from her end to allow only the max amount of customers she can take on at once. This is a fail safe to the automation as without it dating problems could arise.
  2. Creating a custom cake design UX to remove some of the back and forth of cake designing for customers.
  3. Having a checkout and transaction at the end of this UX. Sending an invoice straight through reducing wait time and uncertainty of customers intentions.
